# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
Statistical analysis is conducted to identify key variables that predict the mpg of a new prototype; the following summary statistics were used: multiple linear regression metrics, p-value, r-squared value and T-tests.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:
* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.
